FiSGO: Finite simple groups by order, a Python package whose core functionality is to determine which simple groups divide a given order.

This readme is a work in progress. The readme's of the various directories are already complete.

A `readthedocs page`_ is also in the works. Currently, all the documentation is in the code. Most code of every module is already documented.

This program is part of a (currently unpublished) paper. An Arxiv link will be added soon, and a link to the paper will 
be added to the readme as soon as it is published.
